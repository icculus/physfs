Building is very easy.


ALL PLATFORMS:

Please understand your rights and mine: read the text file LICENSE in the root
of the source tree. If you can't abide by it, delete this source tree now.

The best documentation for the PhysicsFS API is physfs.h. It is VERY heavily
commented, and makes an excellent, in-depth reference to all the functions.


UNIX:

Edit "Makefile", and follow the instructions. The defaults are probably okay
for general purposes, but give it a once over to make sure. If you don't have
zLib on your system, you'll need to disable ZIP support.

run "make"

That's it. The library will be sitting in a new directory called "bin".

Run "make install" to install the library for use on your system.


WIN32:
Download http://icculus.org/physfs/downloads/physfs-win32-support.zip, and
unpack in the root of the source directory, preserving directory names. If you
did it correctly, there should be a directory named "zlibwin32" in the same
directory as "physfs.h". This archive has Visual C project/workspace files and
the code needed for zipfile support in PhysicsFS, since most Windows boxes
don't have zlib preinstalled.

After that, if building with CygWin, follow the Unix instructions, above. If
you're using Visual C, point the IDE at physfs.dsw, and build. If you're using
any other compiler, send me a patch when you get it working.  :)

If someone is willing to maintain prebuilt PhysicsFS DLLs, I'd like to hear
from you; send an email to icculus@clutteredmind.org.


MACOS 8/9:
Download http://icculus.org/physfs/downloads/mac_classic_support.sit and 
unpack it in the root of the physfs folder. It should produce a folder 
called "Mac Classic Support" that has CodeWarrior 6 project files and a 
copy of zlib for zipfile support.

If someone is willing to maintain prebuilt PhysicsFS Shared Libraries for
the Mac, I'd like to hear from you; send an email to icculus@clutteredmind.org.


OTHER PLATFORMS:
Many platforms might "just work" with the Unix Makefile (such as BeOS and 
MacOS X), but have not been tested. To implement a new platform or 
archiver, please read the heavily-commented physfs_internal.h and look 
in the platform/ and archiver/ directories for examples.
