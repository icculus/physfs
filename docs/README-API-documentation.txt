The API documentation is readable in a few ways:

- Read physfs.h; it's _heavily_ documented and the primary source of reference
  documentation for the library.
- Run Doxygen over the header, which produces nicer-to-browse documentation in
  HTML, LaTeX, manpage, etc formats. This is done for you if Doxygen is
  installed and you build the "docs" target in whatever project files CMake
  generated for you.
- Too much trouble? We generated the HTML reference for you, online here:

      https://wiki.icculus.org/PhysicsFS3/

  The wiki is bridged to the headers; most of the documentation is kept in
  sync between the two locations automatically.

- We would love well-written tutorials for the latest version of PhysicsFS!
  If you write one, we would love to list it here. Drop me a line about it:
  icculus@icculus.org ... Thanks!
