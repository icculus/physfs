These are the emails I got approving the change to a zlib license. I have
removed the authors' email addresses for spam safety.  --ryan.

Sounds fine to me.  And it makes it easier for me to use it in d2x. (which has a
very confusing license)

Hi Ryan,
Sorry for the delayed response. (email troubles at
Stanford among other things)

I approve of a switch to the zlib license for
code I own in PhysicsFS, so you can sign off
everything I have there.

Thanks,

You know, I don't think I ever contributed code to physfs, but if you

switch it to the zlib license...

Hi Ryan!

For your mailfilters:

"I approve of a switch to the zlib license for code I own in PhysicsFS."

The change of license makes sense, what use is a library when the target
audience is reluctant to use it. Keep up the good work.

Btw. if you need any other non-babelfish english -> german translations
just contact me.

Hello.  Sorry for delay in reply, things've been messed up for the last couple 
while..

I think that changing it to the Zlib license is a great idea...  never 
realized there were those sort of complications with the LGPL - thought it 
was a much less restrictive license than your plain vanilla GPL, but I guess 
not less restrictive enough.  I've no problem at all with you putting any of 
the code I've contributed under the Zlib license.

Hi,

I have just read the news on icculus.org and I guess I'm one of the
two contributors you could not contact (at least I did not got any
mails from PhysicsFS mailing list for quite a while - so I did not
know what was happenning). 

I really have no problems with this licence switch from LGPL to zlib
and I agree to sign all my contributions (qpak archiver, ruby bindings
and russian translations) under zlib.

I saw that you removed all my contributions from PhysicsFS - now that
I agreed to license change you could revert them. 

-- Ed

P.S. I have mail on icculus.org - if you can't reach me I guess
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is always possible.
